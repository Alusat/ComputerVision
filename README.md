***Computer Vision Project***

**Video followed:** freeCodeCamp.org --- Advanced Computer Vision with Python - Full Course --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY

This project demonstrates hand tracking and body pose estimation using Python and Mediapipe.
It is structured in two main modules: HandTracking and PoseEstimation.

***Requirements***
- See `requirements.txt` for the 2 main required Python libraries.
- **Important:** Mediapipe is NOT compatible with Python 3.13. Use Python 3.10 or 3.11.

***Directory Structure***
- **PoseEstimation/**: Contains scripts and modules to perform full body pose estimation.
  See its README for detailed explanation.

- **HandTracking/**: Contains scripts and modules for hand detection and tracking,
  as well as a small Rock-Paper-Scissors game demonstration.
  See its README for detailed explanation.
